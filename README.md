# social-network
I designed a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

Starter code was provided for this project, which I completed in the context of Harvard UniversityX's [CS50 Introduction to Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.
