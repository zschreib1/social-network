# social-network
I **designed a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users**, using **Django**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**.

Starter code was provided for this project, which I completed in the context of Harvard UniversityX's [CS50 Introduction to Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.

View a short [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSlvI1tTz4Q) of the project.
