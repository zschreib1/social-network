# social-network
I **designed a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users**, using **Django**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**.

Starter code was provided for this project, which I completed in the context of Harvard UniversityX's [CS50 Introduction to Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.

View a short [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSlvI1tTz4Q) of the project.

## Implementation
I completed the implementation of a social network that allows users to **make posts**, **follow other users**, and **“like” posts**. 

**Requirements:**

- *New Post*: Users who are signed in should be able to write a new text-based post by filling in text into a text area and then clicking a button to submit the post.
- *All Posts*: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.
- *Profile Page*: Clicking on a username should load that user’s profile page. 
- *Following*: The “Following” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they see all posts made by users that the current user follows.
- *Pagination*: On any page that displays posts, posts should only be displayed 10 on a page. If there are more than ten posts, a “Next” button should appear to take the user to the next page of posts (which should be older than the current page of posts). If not on the first page, a “Previous” button should appear to take the user to the previous page of posts as well.
- *Edit Post*: Users should be able to click an “Edit” button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post.
- *“Like” and “Unlike”*: Users should be able to click a button or link on any post to toggle whether or not they “like” that post.
